<h1 id="conceptual-model">Conceptual model</h1>
<h2 id="what-we-ideally-would-like-to-measure">What we ideally would like to measure</h2>
<p>On the conceptual level, the indicator aims to address the operational penalty
associated with techniques used to maximize runway utilisation for inbound
traffic flows at an airport, i.e. the accumulation of additional approach time
resulting from speed control, path stretching and circling in the vicinity of
the airport (use of holding patterns/stacks).</p>
<h2 id="concept-of-runway-optimisation">Concept of runway optimisation</h2>
<p>When aircraft cannot fly unimpeded 4D trajectories, there are generally three
places at which queuing takes place, as illustrated in the Figure:</p>
<ol>
 <li>At the departure stand (pre-departure queuing to optimise network
performance)</li>
 <li>At the departure runway (take-off queuing, e.g. runway holding)</li>
 <li>In the arrival terminal airspace (arrival queuing in the Arrival Sequencing
and Metering Area or ASMA, using speed control, stacks, holding, extension of
approach path etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/assets/adasma-01-92ce4a955b693dbfb1d5bb90d803dcecd6cf34e970767197d678465c1b3d48f1.png" alt="Outbound and Inbound Traffic Queues from a Flight Phase Perspective" width="500" height="384" />
<em>Outbound and Inbound Traffic Queues from a Flight Phase Perspective</em></p>
<p>Uncertainty of approach conditions (e.g. pilot performance, landing clearance
time, approach speed, wind conditions) makes traffic supply to runways a
stochastic phenomenon.</p>
<p>In order to ensure continuous traffic demand at runways and maximise runway
usage, a minimum level of queuing is required. A certain extent of arrival
queuing in airspace is necessary to allow arrival management (sequencing and
metering) to optimise runway utilisation when demand is at or near the
operational capacity.</p>
<p>However, additional time in holding is detrimental to operations efficiency,
fuel consumption and environment. Therefore, a trade-off exists between approach
efficiency and runway throughput.</p>
<p>Optimisation of the runway utilisation may require:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Re-sequencing the take-off/ landing order at the runway (first come is not
first served), and</li>
 <li>buffering a sufficient number of aircraft in the queue to be able to fine
tune the metering (to optimise the separation of aircraft released from the
queue to the runway.)</li>
</ol>
<p>In both cases some aircraft will suffer a certain penalty in terms of queuing
time. Higher runway utilisation targets may require higher levels of departure
(take-off) queuing in the manoeuvring area and arrival queuing in airspace. This
effect can be reduced if aircraft are already delivered to the queue in the
right sequence and at the required time intervals.</p>
<p>To reduce cost and environmental impact, the departure and arrival queuing time
should be kept to the minimum needed to achieve the selected runway utilisation
objectives. If possible, any departure and arrival delay that is needed for
other reasons than sequencing and metering should therefore be absorbed at the
departure stand through ATFM delays and local ATC pre-departure delay. If this
is done properly, then measuring outbound and inbound queuing time allows
assessing the “operational cost” associated with sequencing and metering in
function of the selected runway utilisation objectives.</p>
<h2 id="conceptual-approach">Conceptual approach</h2>
<p>The additional ASMA time is a proxy for the management of the arrival flow,
understood as the average arrival runway queuing time on the inbound traffic
flow, during periods of congestion at airports.</p>
<p>Performance in terms of additional ASMA time is monitored on the basis of
regular reporting in comparison to a nominal reference. Based on regular
reporting, metrics are derived for the respective reporting month. The current
measurements are compared to a nominal reference to address the level of
efficiency. The reference is derived from the statistical analysis of a
reference period sample. This approach is depicted in Figure 2. Based on regular
reporting, metrics are derived for the respective reporting month. The current
measurements are compared to a nominal reference to address the level of
efficiency. The reference is derived from the statistical analysis of a
reference period sample.</p>

<em>Performance Measurement Approach</em></p>
<p>The indicator is defined as the difference between the ASMA transit time (actual
ASMA time) and the unimpeded ASMA time, based on ASMA transit times in periods
of low traffic.</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">{Actual\ ASMA\ Time} = {Unimpeded\ ASMA\ Time} + {Additional\ ASMA\ Time}</script>
<p>The unimpeded reference time is determined based on a statistical analysis of
historic data observed at the airport, averaged for groupings of similar
flights. The additional ASMA time is a measure for the extent of which the
actual ASMA time exceeds the unimpeded reference.</p>
<h1 id="logical-model">Logical model</h1>
<p>This section describes the underlying logical modelling and drives the
implementation of the additional ASMA time algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>
<p>The purpose of the <strong>additional ASMA time</strong> indicator is to provide an
approximate measure of the <strong>average inbound queuing time</strong> on the inbound
traffic flow, during times that the airport is congested.</p>
<p>The calculation of this indicator is based on generalised ASMA area defined
around an airport. Aircraft are subject to the management of the arrival flow
upon entering the ASMA area. Accordingly, the time spent within the ASMA area,
i.e. the time elapsing between entering the ASMA area (actual ASMA entry time,
ET) and the actual landing time of an arriving flight (ALDT). The generalised
ASMA area is defined by a cylinder of radius 40NM around the airport extending
to unlimited in terms of altitude.</p>

<em>Conceptual approach for Additional ASMA Time</em></p>
<p>Actual ASMA time refers to the period between the point in time when the
aircraft enters the ASMA cylinder for the last time (‘entry time’) and the
landing time. This ensures a consistent measurement for the inbound flow in the
40 NM around an airport. The additional time is measured as the average
additional time beyond the unimpeded ASMA time, which is a statistically
determined reference time based on actual ASMA times in periods of low traffic
demand.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The indicator is currently defined for a radius of 40 NM to allow for
comparability across Europe. For monitoring purposes, a supporting metric
considering a radius of 100NM is calculated by PRU (the 40/100NM positions and
timestamps are calculated from data feeds the Network Manager receives from
member states.)</p>
<p>This indicator excludes influence of the following factors:</p>
<ol>
 <li>
   <p>Impact of noise management and terrain clearance aspects: the same effects
are included in both the impeded and unimpeded transit times; therefore this
does not show up in the additional time which is the difference between
impeded and unimpeded.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p>Effect of runway friction deteriorations: periods with such conditions are
excluded. The calculation algorithm does not explicitly take any weather
conditions into account.</p>
 </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="grouping-of-flights">Grouping of flights</h2>
<p>To reduce the number of combinations of unique entry points and arrival runway,
arriving flights entering the ASMA area within certain limits are grouped
together. The clustering is based on observed arrival flows (i.e. crossing of
flown trajectory with the ASMA cylinder).</p>
<p>The result of this clustering yields the <strong>ASMA sectors</strong> and may not be
confused with the actual TMA or approach sectors around the airport. Each ASMA
sector covers a major arrival flow, and the extent of the sector is based on
visualization of arrival radar tracks (see figure below) and the aforementioned
entry points.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/asmasectors-bf6c7019f3a98b9b7c2472fdbccba6d2b19f205cfb32d8e62fac09c3aa64259c.jpg" alt="ASMA sectors and bearing" width="450" height="198" />
<em>ASMA sectors and bearing</em></p>
<p>The indicator is first calculated at disaggregated level, i.e. per comparable
<strong>grouping</strong> of flights with the same combination of <strong>ASMA sector</strong>, <strong>landing
runway</strong> and <strong>aircraft class</strong>. Each grouping of flights has an unimpeded
reference associated.</p>
<p>Taking the weighted average of the values for all groups produces the ASMA
additional time for the airport.</p>

<p>The unimpeded ASMA time for each flight is taken from the unimpeded reference

flights from a reference sample (e.g. one year worth of data). The basis of the
algorithm is to determine which flights are unimpeded.</p>
<p>The unimpeded ASMA time corresponds to the ASMA time that an aircraft of a given
triplet, aircraft type – entry sector – runway combination, would spend if no
additional sequencing time would be added, i.e., if the operation would be
unimpeded. The unimpeded times are calculated from a reference data set, and
their values are constant for each triplet combination.</p>
<p>The process steps are described below:</p>
<ol>

 <li>From these flights, determine which flights are unimpeded by comparing

 <li>The unimpeded time is calculated as the median of all flights in the grouping

when the airport is congested.</p>
<p>Mathematically, the actual ASMA transit time per flight is calculated as the

<h4 id="step-3b-calculation-of-airport-peak-hourly-arrival-throughput">Step 3b: Calculation of Airport Peak Hourly Arrival Throughput</h4>
<p>The next step is defining the airport peak hourly arrival throughput, which is a
theoretical hourly rate based on the truncated 20min window prior to the
arrival. The – theoretical – maximum airport arrival throughput is seen as
determinant of the level of traffic saturation and, thus, the threshold at which
effects of congestion can be observed.</p>
<p>For each aircraft landing at airport A, the number of aircraft that landed in
the previous 20 minutes is counted.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/adasma-step3b-bf6c7019f3a98b9b7c2472fdbccba6d2b19f205cfb32d8e62fac09c3aa64259c.png" alt="Step 3b" width="450" height="89" />
<em>Step 3b</em></p>
<p>Let <script type="math/tex">t_i</script> be the arrival time of the aircraft <script type="math/tex">i</script>, <script type="math/tex">n</script> be the number of
aircraft that have landed in the window <script type="math/tex">[t_i − 20, t_i ]</script> and <script type="math/tex">f_i</script> the
landing time of the first aircraft in the window. Then, the arrival rate during
this period is given by</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\text{hourly rate} = \frac{n - 1}{t_i - f_i}</script>
<p>The numerator of the fraction is expressed as <script type="math/tex">n – 1</script> to denote that the
aircraft <script type="math/tex">i</script> is excluded for the calculation of the rate.</p>
<p>Therefore, the arrival throughput for each flight <script type="math/tex">f_{c_i}</script> is calculated as:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\text{hourly rate}(f_{c_j}) = \frac{count - 1}{base}</script>
<p>where</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">{count}  =  \sum f  \quad \textrm{for } f \textrm{ such that} \quad {ALDT}(f_{c_i}) - 20\, \text{min} \leq {ALDT}(f) \leq {ALDT}(f_{c_i})</script>

    {ALDT}(f) \in [{ALDT}(f_{c_i}) - 20 \, \text{min},  {ALDT}(f_{c_i})]</script>
<p>For example, for a flight landing at 07:04:00hrs, the first preceding arrival is
observed at 06:45:04. The resulting rate base is hence 18:56 minutes. Assuming 9
arrivals would be observed in this window (without counting the flight 07:04:00
flight), this yields a (theoretical) hourly throughput of:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\textrm{hourly departure throughput}(\text{flight}) = \
\frac{9\, \textrm{flights}}{ {18:56}\, \textrm{min}} = \
0.4754 \frac{\textrm{flights}}{\textrm{min}} = \
28.52 \frac{\textrm{flights}}{\textrm{hour}}</script>
<p>The peak hourly arrival throughput of the airport, <script type="math/tex">R_j</script> , is calculated as
the 90 percentile of all <script type="math/tex">\text{hourly rate}</script> values in the reference sample</p>

<em>Step 3d</em></p>
<h4 id="step-3e-determination-of-the-saturation-level-per-grouping">Step 3e: Determination of the Saturation Level per grouping</h4>
<p>While the congestion level is a measure for the traffic encountered by an
individual flight, the saturation threshold describes the maximum traffic level
served under non-congested traffic conditions. As an upper bound for the
saturation threshold, the saturation level can be estimated as the maximum
number of aircraft landing under non-congested conditions (expressed by the
first estimate of the unimpeded ASMA time).</p>
<p>Dependent on the previous steps 3b and 3d the saturation level is calculated by
multiplying the estimate of the unimpeded time U1 with the peak hourly
throughput <script type="math/tex">R_j</script>, to provide an estimation of the (theoretical) maximum number
of arrivals per hour served by the airport without congestion. The result is
rounded to the next unit.</p>
<p><script type="math/tex">L(c_i)</script>, the saturation level of the grouping <script type="math/tex">c_i</script>, is calculated as:
<script type="math/tex">L(c_i) = \textrm{round}(\frac{R_j U_1(c_i)}{60})</script></p>
<h3 id="step-4-identification-of-unimpeded-flights">Step 4: Identification of unimpeded flights</h3>
<p>To ensure that a flight is unimpeded, its congestion level needs to be
sufficiently smaller than the saturation level. Departing flights are considered
as non-congested, if their congestion limit is equal or below the saturation
threshold.</p>
<p>However, it needs to be ensured that the data sample is big enough to produce a
statistically relevant sample for the chosen stand/runway combination and robust
estimate of the unimpeded time.</p>
<p>To limit the impact of any congestion effect (and to address the sample size),
the saturation threshold is estimated as a fraction of the saturation level.
This limitation is achieved with the definition of the congestion limit
<script type="math/tex">{cl}</script>, a constant defined in Step 3a.</p>
<p>Based on the previous outputs, the identification of the unimpeded flights is
done: the saturation level, corrected with the congestion limit, is compared to
the congestion level.</p>

<p>With the aim of designating the unimpeded flights,<script type="math/tex">{fu}_{c_i}</script> is defined as a
binary variable, denoting that a flight <script type="math/tex">f_{c_i}</script> belonging to the grouping
<script type="math/tex">c_i</script> is an unimpeded flight. A flight is considered unimpeded if its
congestion level <script type="math/tex">{seq}(f_{c_i})</script> is less than or equal to the product of
congestion limit <script type="math/tex">{cl}</script> and the flight’s grouping saturation level <script type="math/tex">L(c_i)</script>.</p>

<p>The unimpeded ASMA time per grouping is computed as the median of the ASMA time
only for the unimpeded flights.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/adasma-step5-7901f3ebe31f6cae13e98388d847c112907bd35875d9d109adcf273c7b65899b.png" alt="Step 5" width="700" height="111" />
<em>Step 5</em></p>
<p>The unimpeded ASMA time <script type="math/tex">\text{UASMA}(c_i)</script> for a grouping <script type="math/tex">c_i</script> is a
calculated constant at the airport <script type="math/tex">j</script>.</p>
<p>In order to derive statistically meaningful and representative unimpeded times
per group, only those groupings with equal or more than 20 flights are retained
in the calculation. For groupings <script type="math/tex">c_i</script> that have less than 20 unimpeded
flights <script type="math/tex">\text{fu}_{c_i}</script>, the associated unimpeded time <script type="math/tex">\text{UASMA}(c_i)</script>
is not calculated. These groupings 𝑐𝑖 do not have unimpeded times (consequently,
it is not possible to calculate additional ASMA time for those groupings).</p>
<p>Night flights are excluded from the calculation at this point, so only the
flights taking off during day time are considered for the calculation of the
reference unimpeded times. On the standard calculation day time is defined
between 06:30 and 22:00 of airport local time. Calibration of day time
definition may lead to different definition in some of the busiest airports (see
section 5).</p>
<p>For the groupings <script type="math/tex">c_i</script> that have 20 or more unimpeded flights, the unimpeded
time is defined as the median of the Actual ASMA Transit Time
<script type="math/tex">\text{AcASMA}(f_{c_i})</script>, of all unimpeded flights <script type="math/tex">\text{fu}_{c_i}</script>
belonging to the grouping of flights.</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\text{UASMA}(c_i) =
\begin{cases}
    \textrm{median}(\text{AcASMA}(f_{c_i})),& \forall c_i \in \textrm{count}(\text{fu}_{c_i}) \geq 20 \\
    \textrm{null},& \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} %]]></script>
<p>These times are aggregated in Unimpeded References Tables for the calculation of
the additional ASMA time as described in Section 4.1.</p>
<p>Although unimpeded ASMA time constants for each 𝑐𝑖 are relatively static in
time, regular checks are made to ensure that they remain representative of the
operations for the airport under consideration (see section 5.2). In case a
change of unimpeded times is detected, the causes of that change (i.e. new
procedure implementation, change of TMA design) are investigated. When required,
new unimpeded time constants are calculated. However, because the unimpeded time
constants calculation method is based on statistical analysis of the Actual ASMA
transit time, a period of several months after the change is required before new
robust unimpeded times can be established.</p>
<h1 id="calibration-of-model-parameters">Calibration of model parameters</h1>
<p>This section describes the model parameters that need to be customized for every
airport, and the approach used for obtaining and updating them.</p>
<p>For the additional ASMA time indicator, the parameters that need manual
calibration are the ASMA sectors and the unimpeded times.</p>
<h2 id="asma-sectors">ASMA sectors</h2>
<p>For a given runway configuration, the ASMA transit time depends on the direction
from which the ASMA cylinder is entered. For this reason, the ASMA cylinder is
divided into so-called ASMA sectors. The ASMA sectors are defined according to a
statistical cluster analysis of the distribution of the inbound traffic. The
figure shows the sectorization for Heathrow</p>
<p><img src="/assets/asmasectors-8639ac525f71c21e06ce29de3d20ee1a1e04307c5bd79dd5ece146d66a412c73.jpg" alt="ASMA sectors and bearing" width="350" height="154" />
<em>ASMA sectors and bearing</em></p>
<p>The ASMA entry bearings are checked every month to investigate whether there are
any changes in the arrival flows directions. In case substantial changes in the
arrival flow directions are identified, the differences will be investigated
with the particular airport, and the ASMA sectors will be updated if applicable.</p>
<h2 id="unimpeded-times">Unimpeded times</h2>
<p>The base period for the calculation of Unimpeded times (which are constants for
each one of the groupings) is the year 2011, but this can vary across the
different airports.</p>
<p>Unimpeded times are calculated once, over 1 year, and they are kept in a static
reference table.</p>
<p>As part of the manual quality analysis of the results, the unimpeded times are
recalculated every month to investigate whether there are any changes in
unimpeded times. Changes at the airport and the airspace design can have an
impact on the unimpeded times. Only in the cases that the substantial changes
are reported for an airport, the differences will be investigated with the
particular airport. If the change is due to a change in the airport
characteristics that require a new performance reference, the reference
unimpeded times will be modified accordingly.</p>
<p>Because the unimpeded time constants calculation method is based on statistical
analysis of the actual ASMA time, a period of three months after the change is
required before new robust unimpeded times references can be established.</p>
<h3 id="example-of-unimpeded-times-recalculation">Example of unimpeded times recalculation</h3>
<p>The following represents an example considering an airport XXXX with its
reference unimpeded times based on the full year of 2011.</p>
<p>As part of the monthly values calculation, the unimpeded times will be
recalculated each month (e.g. for June 2014) and compared with the “reference”
ones (based on 2011).</p>
<ul>
 <li>
   <p>If the values are considered similar enough, the static values will be kept:
the airport reference period will still be 2011. The validity of the reference
unimpeded times based on 2011 will be extended to June 2014)</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p>If a change is detected in the June 2014 results (the unimpeded times
recalculated based on June 2014 are significantly different from the 2011
ones), the issue will be investigated and discussed with the airport, in order
to decide which new reference to take. If, for example, the change was due to
a new runway opened in June 2014, the new reference will be the following
year: June 2014-June 2015. However, if the difference corresponds to a runway
closure of 3 months, the reference would be modified only for the affected 3
months.</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>Two parameters can trigger the renewal of the unimpeded time reference for one
airport, each month:</p>
<ul>
 <li>
   <p>The number of flights that do not have unimpeded reference (are not in a
grouping with more than 20 unimpeded flights) are more than 10% of the total
traffic of the concerned month.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p>The standard deviation of the unimpeded times of all the flights of the month
is higher than 2 minutes.</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="day-time">Day Time</h2>
<p>Due to extended opening hours in certain airports, day time may be extended for
the filtering of the flights in the unimpeded ASMA time calculation.</p>
<h1 id="source-data">Source data</h1>
<h2 id="main-and-secondary-data-sources">Main and secondary data sources</h2>
<p>The additional ASMA time indicator is calculated using data provided by the
airport operators and the Network Manager:</p>
<ul>
 <li>
   <p>The airport operators provide the Actual Landing times, the aircraft type and
the runways used for the arrivals.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p>The Network Manager (NM) provides the entry points to the ASMA cylinder
(position and time of entry) coming from the Correlated Position Reports
(CPR). CPR are built from ANSP radar track data for both 40NM and 100NM. When
CPR data for ASMA entry point data is not available, the data from NM’s
Current Tactical Flight Model (CTFM) is used as a substitute.</p>

<h2 id="the-airport-operator-data-flow-process">The Airport Operator Data Flow process</h2>
<p>The airport operator data flow (APDF) comprises all data collection, processing,
and performance indicator calculation sub-processes. Reporting entities (i.e.
airport operators) submit their data to EUROCONTROL on a monthly basis and in
compliance with the APDF data specification.</p>
<p>Several activities are performed in the data flow process, involving different
actors, until Performance reports are published. As a summary, a high level
overview of the activities can be found below:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/adasma-08-fc3fe8e861df168130797d8010a1c3fb2604a5bb1f1f2a5bc9f38d9a152f17a7.png" alt="Airport Data Flow process scheme including activities and actors involved" width="800" height="295" />
<em>Airport Data Flow process scheme including activities and actors involved.</em></p>
<p>The airport operator data flow can be conceptualised as stages sub-processes:</p>
<ul>
 <li>APDF_1 – Data Collection</li>
 <li>APDF_2 – Data Validation</li>
 <li>APDF_3 – Data Extract, Transform and Load</li>
 <li>APDF_4 – Data Merging</li>
 <li>APDF_5 – Pre-Computation of performance parameters</li>
 <li>APDF_6 – Calculation of Performance Indicators</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the sub-processes are governed by quality assurance measures. The PRU
assumes responsibility for the whole flow in terms of quality assurance. Data
collection and initial validation is performed by CODA. Once the data is loaded,
the data processes within the EUROCONTROL data warehouse are managed by PRISME.
In the final stage, PRU extracts the relevant data and computes the performance
metrics and indicators.</p>
<p>APDF related documentation is published under the PRU Quality Management System.</p>
<h2 id="quality-assurance-framework">Quality Assurance Framework</h2>
<p>Quality assessment on airport data flow process is focused towards implementing
a Quality Assurance Framework based on the ISO 9001 standard. The airport
operator data flow process includes several data processing activities, starting
from the moment flight information is provided by the reporting entity until
performance reports are released.</p>
<p>Standard Operating Procedures for all these sub-processes have been established
and is quality controlled.</p>
<p>The documentation is published under the PRU Quality Management System.</p>
<h2 id="data-quality-checks">Data Quality Checks</h2>
<p>For the APDF the following quality areas have been identified. Quality controls
in support of these quality areas are implemented and regularly monitored as
part of the aforementioned APDF sub-processes.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/adasma-09-7901f3ebe31f6cae13e98388d847c112907bd35875d9d109adcf273c7b65899b.png" alt="Quality Performance Areas and corresponding Quality Indicators" width="700" height="266" />
<em>Quality Performance Areas and corresponding Quality Indicators</em></p>
<p>More detail on these quality checks can be found in the Airport Data Flow Data Specifications (see [3]).</p>
<h2 id="performance-indicator-quality-checks">Performance Indicator Quality Checks</h2>
<p>The average additional ASMA time per flight grouped by airport and month
represents the main result from the performance indicator calculation process.
In addition, this process provides parameters that are used for data validation
and statistical analysis:</p>
<ul>
 <li>
   <p>average unimpeded time</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p>standard deviation</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p>Values for 25%,50% and 75% percentiles</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p>number of flights, number of unimpeded flights and number of flights with
valid data</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p>total additional time, unimpeded time and 25%, 50% and 75% percentile</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p>completeness and coverage of the traffic sample</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>These metrics are used for PRU internal validation activities and may trigger
case-by-case analyses if significant variations are observed.</p>
