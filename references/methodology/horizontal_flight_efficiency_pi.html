<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<p>This document describes the conceptual, informational, and implementation
independent model of the Horizontal Flight Efficiency Indicators – KEP and KEA.</p>
<p>The indicator is used as part of the performance monitoring and reporting under:</p>
<ul>
 <li>SES: IR691/2010 <a href="#eu:691/2010">(European Commission 2010)</a> and IR390/2013

</ul>
<h2 id="purpose-of-the-document">Purpose of the document</h2>
<p>The purpose of this document is to provide a description of the horizontal
flight efficiency indicator and its two versions used in the Performance Scheme
Regulation – KEP and KEA. It addresses different audiences with different needs,
and for that reason the description is provided at increasing level of detail.</p>
<p>Section <a href="#summary-of-the-performance-indicator-information">Summary of the performance indicator information</a>
provides a high level description of the indicator, introduces the 
concept of achieved distance and provides the rationale for its use as the base
for the computation of the additional distance (i.e., the balance of the need to
evaluate local performance with the need to take into consideration its impact
on the measurement of network performance). It includes a final subsection with
some special cases and frequently asked questions which should help clarify how
it is calculated.</p>
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>This document covers the data processing and calculation of the Horizontal
Flight Efficiency key performance indicators (KEP and KEA).</p>
<p>The calculation of this performance indicator is performed according to the
Horizontal Flight Efficiency Data Flow standard for data collection and
processing, under the responsibility of the operations unit in the QoS
department of the PRU, which is compliant with IR691/2010 and IR390/2013. The
Horizontal Flight Efficiency Data Flow associated processes and procedures are
documented as part of the PRU Quality Management System.</p>
<p>These key performance indicators are also defined in the Implementing Regulation
(390/2013), Annex I:</p>
<ul>
 <li>
   <p>Section 1, Environment 2.1, (a) (KEA, Union-wide level);</p>

<h1 id="conceptual-model-the-horizontal-flight-efficiency">Conceptual model The Horizontal Flight Efficiency</h1>
<p>Horizontal flight efficiency (HFE) is very simply defined at its highest level:
the comparison between the length of a trajectory and the shortest distance
between its endpoints.</p>
<figure class="img-responsive center-block">
  <img src="/assets/hfe-01-35620d03a188717db7b70d9d96849c36502baebf847bc0dd809b1de7ae1374dc.png" width="400" height="329" alt="hfe-01-35620d03a188717db7b70d9d96849c36502baebf847bc0dd809b1de7ae1374dc.png" />
 <figcaption>Figure 1 HFE as comparison of flight length and Great Circle Distance</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For an entire flight we want to calculate the additional distance flown between
take-off and landing with respect to the most direct route between the two
airports (Great Circle Distance). The need of a more detailed definition arises
because we need to take into consideration different variations from the
situation described above, such as the possibility that one (if not both) of the
airports does not belong to the area on which we would like to measure the
efficiency and the need to define the measurement on a portion of the flight
(e.g., en route) instead than for the whole trajectory.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a specific need which stems from the requirements of
Reference Period 2 (RP2) <strong>to measure local performance (FAB level) while at the
same time keeping the network perspective.</strong></p>
<figure class="img-responsive center-block">
  <img src="/assets/hfe-02-7901f3ebe31f6cae13e98388d847c112907bd35875d9d109adcf273c7b65899b.png" width="700" height="314" alt="hfe-02-7901f3ebe31f6cae13e98388d847c112907bd35875d9d109adcf273c7b65899b.png" />
 <figcaption>Figure 2: Local Performance Requirement</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The desired outcome is illustrated in the table above. We are interested in all
flights which traverse at least in part the Single European Sky (SES) area. A
flight might traverse several FABs but also areas which are not part of the SES
area. This means that, for the purpose of measuring flight efficiency in the SES
area, we are interested only in the values in the green cells of the table. At
the same time we would like to be able to consider the additional distances
along the flight dimension (i.e., along a row, giving a flight value in the
light blue cell in the last column) and along the FAB dimension (i.e., along a
column, giving a FAB value in the light blue cell in the last row) and obtain
consistent values. The sum of the all values in the green cells, the sum of all
values in the last column (i.e. sum of flight values) and the sum of all values
in the last row (i.e., sum of the FAB values) should all be the same (i.e.,
using flight values and using FAB values should lead to the same sum when
considering all flights in the SES area).</p>
<p>This is true when the values in the table correspond to the flown distance and
the achieved distance (defined in the following section), which allows to
apportion the great circle distance for the entire trajectory to any of its
parts, e.g., between the entry and exit into a FAB.</p>
<h2 id="the-achieved-distance">The achieved distance</h2>
<p>The achieved distance is the average of two quantities. The first quantity
considers how closer to destination the trajectory takes from its entry point
into an area to its exit point from the area (left part of
Figure 3). This can be calculated as the
difference between</p>
<ol>
 <li>the great circle distance from the entry point N to the destination D and</li>
 <li>the great circle distance from the exit point X to the destination D.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="img-responsive center-block">
  <img src="/assets/hfe-03-3fedcd80dc3f31cbe792c6cae9fc956762c9736259d66d5293f27906e2b7a204.png" width="550" height="371" alt="hfe-03-3fedcd80dc3f31cbe792c6cae9fc956762c9736259d66d5293f27906e2b7a204.png" />
 <figcaption>Figure 3: The two Quantities Averaged in the Achieved Distance</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the Figure 3, the distance from $N$ to
$D$ is the radius of the circle centred at $D$ and going through the point of
entry $N$, while the distance from $X$ to $D$ is the radius of the circle
centred at $D$ and going through the point $X$.</p>
<p>In a similar way the second quantity considers how further from origin the
trajectory takes from its entry point into an area to its exit point from the
area (right part of the picture). The roles of the entry point $N$ and the exit
point $X$ are reversed and the quantity is calculated as the difference between</p>
<ol>
 <li>the great circle distance from the origin $O$ and the exit point $X$, and</li>
 <li>the great circle distance from the origin $O$ and the entry point $N$.</li>
</ol>
<p>Considering two specific points along the trajectory (for example its entry
point $N$ and its exit point $X$ into/from an area), together with the origin
$O$ and the destination $D$, the formula to compute the achieved distance is:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{1}{2} ( {ND} - {XD} + {OX} - {ON} )</script>
<p>where all the distances between points are calculated as great circle distances.</p>
<p>It can be verified that taking a sequence of points between $O$ and $D$, e.g., a
sequence of entry/exit points in different areas, the sum of the achieved
distances (including the one from the origin to the first point and the one from
the last point to the destination) is equal to the great circle distance between
the origin and the destination.</p>
<h2 id="achieved-distances-and-network-contribution">Achieved distances and network contribution</h2>
<p>It might seem natural to consider the comparison of the flown distance in a
local area with the great circle distance between the entry and exit point of
the same area. Such a measurement would not take into consideration the network
perspective, as can be seen in the (extreme, for illustration purposes) example
of the Figure 4.</p>
<figure class="img-responsive center-block">
  <img src="/assets/hfe-04-345ce290aaf5fa6f4b2c97bfd811db851a16fb6bad75313ba48b401ae69ea9f6.png" width="480" height="322" alt="hfe-04-345ce290aaf5fa6f4b2c97bfd811db851a16fb6bad75313ba48b401ae69ea9f6.png" />
 <figcaption>Figure 4: A case of perfect local efficiency with no network contribution</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The red trajectory between the entry point N and the exit point X is perfectly
straight and would be considered perfectly efficient from the local point of
view, while from the network perspective there has been no improvement as the
aircraft would be no closer to destination (and no further from the origin).</p>
<p>The great circle distance taken as reference is the one between the origin and
destination of the flight. The sum of the great circle distances in the
different areas traversed is always larger than the great circle distance
between origin and destination. Given that the sum of the flown distance would
be the same, using local great circle distances for the comparison would always
underestimate the inefficiency at flight level. The achieved distances, on the
other hand, do sum up to the great circle distance between origin and
destination.</p>
<h2 id="decomposition-of-inefficiency-in-local-and-interface-components">Decomposition of inefficiency in local and interface components</h2>
<p>The value of the achieved distance between two points is by construction less
than the direct distance between the same two points. This enables a
decomposition of the inefficiency into a local component (which we call
extension) and a network contribution (which we call interface) as shown in
the Figure 5.</p>
<figure class="img-responsive center-block">
  <img src="/assets/hfe-05-4806cc30dcfcb9123c7139011182277adc73bca9c159bbd6747697af2226d027.png" width="600" height="182" alt="hfe-05-4806cc30dcfcb9123c7139011182277adc73bca9c159bbd6747697af2226d027.png" />
 <figcaption>Figure 5: Decomposition of Inefficiency</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the example of the previous section, the extension is zero (the red line
corresponds to the direct between entry and exit) and the inefficiency is equal
to the interface value. The exact interface value would depend on the position
of the entry and exit points with respect to the origin and destination of the
trajectory. If both $N$ and $X$ were equidistant from the origin and destination
(i.e., $\overline{OX} = \overline{𝑋𝐷}$ and $\overline{ON} = \overline{ND}$) the
achieved distance would be zero and the interface value would be equal to the
direct distance between entry and exit. From the network point of view, since
there is “no improvement” in the goal of getting from origin to destination, any
distance flown between the two points should be considered as additional
distance.</p>
<h2 id="independence-of-local-performance-from-performance-outside-the-local-area">Independence of local performance from performance outside the local area</h2>
<figure class="img-responsive center-block">
  <img src="/assets/hfe-06-7901f3ebe31f6cae13e98388d847c112907bd35875d9d109adcf273c7b65899b.png" width="700" height="210" alt="hfe-06-7901f3ebe31f6cae13e98388d847c112907bd35875d9d109adcf273c7b65899b.png" />
 <figcaption>Figure 6: Independence of local performance from performance outside the local area</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The value of the achieved distance to be considered for a local area depends
only on the position of the entry and exit points with respect to the origin and
destination of the trajectory. As a consequence, the value of the local
inefficiency is independent from the characteristics of the rest of the
trajectory.</p>
<p>Consider the situation in Figure 6 (once again an
extreme example to illustrate the point), with two flights traversing a FAB, one
with a direct trajectory from the origin to destination (thus both inside and
outside the FAB), and the other with a direct (and aligned) trajectory inside
the FAB but with an inefficient trajectory outside the FAB.</p>
<p>With the achieved distance, the value used for the FAB measurement will be the
same for both flights because inside the FAB the trajectory is identical (in
this specific case both the extension and the interface will be zero, as the
trajectory is direct between entry and exit and the entry and exit points are
aligned with the origin and destination).</p>
<p>It has been proposed to compute the value of the local efficiency as the
average, taken over all flights traversing the local area, of the entire
trajectories. In the example above, while the two trajectories are identical
within the FAB, their contribution would be different because the inefficiency
of trajectory $1$ outside the FAB will be taken into account (as a matter of
fact, the calculation would not isolate the local performance). As a result, the
inefficiency of the FAB will also be greater than zero.</p>
<h2 id="summary-of-the-different-quantities">Summary of the different quantities</h2>
<p><a href="#tab:summary">Table 3</a> below provides a summary of the different quantities
involved in the computation of the additional distance (and therefore the
inefficiency) for a flight. As can be seen in the last column, while the lengths
of the trajectory, the achieved distances and the additional distances are
additive, the same is not true for the lengths of direct
course, the extensions and the interfaces. In particular, it
should be noted that it is the sum of the achieved distances which corresponds
to the great circle distance for the flight, not the sum of the length of direct
courses.</p>

<h2 id="aggregation-of-results-to-produce-the-indicator">Aggregation of results to produce the indicator</h2>
<p>Once the origin and destination of a flight have been set, via the use of
achieved distances it is possible to compute in a consistent way the value of
the indicator between any two points of the trajectory of a flight. It is
important to note that the flight efficiency is an average measurement where
<strong>the average is taken over distances and not over flights</strong>. This is
particularly useful when dealing with three specific aspects:</p>
<ul>
 <li>
   <p>The measurement of the en-route flight inefficiency. The indicator is
concerned with the enroute flight inefficiency defined as the measurement
which excludes 40 nautical miles around airports. The measurement does not
start until the trajectory has crossed (for the first time) the cylinder with
a 40 nautical miles radius around the airport of departure and ends when the
trajectory crosses (for the last time) the cylinder with a 40 nautical miles
radius around the airport of arrival.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p>The measurement of local inefficiencies. The indicator based on achieved
distances is well defined even when the direct route between origin and
destination does not cross the local area. It is also well defined when a
trajectory exits and re-enters a local area (the two measurements are
independent).</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p>The measurement of inefficiency when the trajectory is not complete (which
might be the case for CPF trajectories). The measurement is well defined for
every portion of the trajectory, and does not require a complete trajectory.</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>When looking at a specific flight, it is always possible to decompose the flight
in different portions, of which some will not be taken into consideration for
the calculation of the indicator (as an example, the first part of the
trajectory will never be included because it will either be inside the 40
nautical miles or outside of the reference area). Every portion can be
attributed to a specific measured area (e.g., a State, a FAB, the SES area).</p>
<p>Flight efficiency compares the length of a trajectory with the great circle
distance. The indicator is expressed as a ratio of the length of trajectories
and achieved distances:</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">{HFE}_j = \frac{\sum L_{fjp} - \sum H_{fjp}}{\sum H{fjp}} \% = \left( \frac{\sum L_{fjp}}{\sum H_{fjp}} - 1 \right) \%</script>
<p>In words, the en route horizontal flight efficiency indicator for an area j is
taken by summing the values over all flights f and all en route portions p in
the area (a flight might re-enter the area).</p>
<p>At a technical level, it is worth noting again that the indicator is an average
per distance unit and not per flight.</p>
<h2 id="difference-between-kep-and-kea">Difference between KEP and KEA</h2>
<p>There is no difference in the methodology used to calculate the value of the two
indicators. The KEP indicator is the horizontal flight efficiency calculated
using the last filed flight plans to describe the trajectories, while KEA uses
the trajectories generated via radar data.</p>
<p>In order to smooth out the influence of unusual events, in reporting annual
values the ten best days and the ten worst days (for each measured area) will be
excluded from the computation.</p>
<h2 id="specificspecial-cases-and-faq">Specific/special cases and FAQ</h2>
<p>The origin and destination points are defined via the reference area chosen,
while the definition of the end route portion of the flight depends on the 40
nautical miles cylinder (cylinder and circle are used interchangeably) around
the airports. In the general case in which the airports and the corresponding
circles are fully inside or outside the reference area the following table is
valid (the definition of the type of flight is based on the location of the
airports with respect to the reference area):</p>

<p class="table-caption">Table 4: General location of origin, destination and en-route end-points</p>
<ol>
 <li>
   <p><strong>What is the difference between reference area and measured area?</strong></p>
   <p>The reference area is the one used to identify the origin and the destination
of a flight. A measured area is an area for which HFE values are reported.
Any measured area (e.g., State, FAB, SES area) must be contained in the
reference area.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p><strong>What is the definition of origin and destination?</strong></p>
   <p>The origin and destination correspond to the first and last point of the
trajectory within the reference area, where the trajectory considered is the
entire trajectory from airport to airport. Any portion of the trajectory
before the origin and after the destination is ignored when calculating the
flight efficiency. There is one origin and one destination for each
trajectory. Origin and destination are defined at trajectory level – O and D
in the notation used in previous section are the same for all entries and
exits of a trajectory.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p><strong>What happens when the trajectory crosses the 40 nautical miles cylinder
several times?</strong></p>
   <p>Only one point is taken into consideration for each airport. For the
departure airport it corresponds to the first crossing, while for the arrival
airport it corresponds to the last crossing. The en route part of the flight
is the one between those two points. Any portion before or after the en route
part is ignored when calculating the en route flight efficiency. The start
and the end en route phase are defined at trajectory level.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p><strong>What happens when the circle around the airport is not fully inside/outside
the reference area?</strong><br />
<strong>What happens when the en route portion begins/ends inside a measured area?</strong><br />
<strong>What happens when part of the trajectory is not available?</strong></p>
   <p>All the above questions relate to the definition of the portions of
trajectory used for the calculation of the en route indicator for a measured
area. Four separate and independent aspects have to be considered:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>A portion has to be within the origin and the destination (for flight
efficiency to be defined);</li>
     <li>A portion has to be en route (i.e., the cylinders around airports have to
excluded);</li>
     <li>A portion has to be within the measured area;</li>
     <li>The information has to be available.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The four conditions have to be valid at the same time. This means that in some
cases the end points of the portion considered for flight efficiency in a
measured area (the entry N and the exit X in the notation used in previous
sections) will not correspond to the borders of the measured area.</p>
   <p>The main reason for the entry/exit points not being on the border of the
measured area is the exclusion of the circles around the airport (see table
above and the following examples). A secondary reason is the absence of
information for a part of a trajectory (see example below).</p>
   <p>Consider the case of a flight departing from a measured area A, with the
circle/cylinder entirely contained in the measurement area A. The origin ($O_f$)
will be the airport because it will be the first point into the reference area
(a measured area is always part of the reference area). As the part within the
cylinder has to be excluded when measuring the en route flight efficiency, the
entry into the measured area ($N_A$) will correspond to the first crossing of
the (departure airport) cylinder. It is neither the airport (airports can never
be the entry or exit point for en route flight efficiency because of the
exclusion of the circle around them) nor the border of the measured area A. The
situation corresponds to the standard “departing” or “internal” row in the table
above.</p>
   <p>Consider the same case above, except that the circle extends into another
measured area B and the first crossing is happening there. The origin will still
be located at the airport in measured area A, but there will be no portion of
trajectory considered for measured area A because the en route part will not
have started. The entry into measured area B (NB) will again correspond to the
first crossing of the (departure airport) cylinder and not the airport or the
border of measured area B.</p>
   <p>As a third alternative, consider the case where the circle around area A extends
outside the reference area, the first crossing happens there and the flight then
re-enter measured area A. The origin will again be located at the airport; the
en route portion will start outside the reference area; the first entry into
area A (NA) will be the one from outside the reference area.</p>
   <p>Last, consider the case where a flight traverses a measured area, with entry and
exit on the borders but with a part of the trajectory for which the information
is missing. In that case there will be two portions of the trajectory
considered: the first one from the border ($N_1$) until the information is lost
($X_1$) and a second one from when the information is again available ($N_2$)
until the exit from the measured area ($X_2$).</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p><strong>What happens when the trajectory enters an area several times?</strong></p>
   <p>Every couple of entry and exit points (see the previous answer for why the
entry and exit points might not correspond to points on the border of the
measured area considered) defines a portion of the flight for which the length
of the trajectory and the achieved distance can be calculated. All portions
within a measured area are considered in the calculation of the indicator for
that area.</p>
   <p>It is important to note that multiple entries are considered separately and it
is not the first point of entry and the last point of exit of a measured area
which are considered (see last example in the previous question).</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p><strong>Can the achieved distance be negative?</strong></p>
   <p>The achieved distance relies on the order of the points considered; it is
therefore possible (although uncommon) for the local achieved distance to be
negative. This ensures that the calculation of the local additional distances
is consistent (any partition of the trajectory gives the same result).</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p><strong>What is the impact of short flights (for which the great circle distance is small)?</strong></p>
   <p>The horizontal flight efficiency (HFE) is not an average per flight, but a
weighted average which takes into consideration the great circle distance
($K$ is the additional distance, $G$ is the great circle distance, $H$ is the
achieved distance; $f$ indicates a flight, $j$ indicates an area, $p$
indicates a portion of the flight):</p>
    <script type="math/tex; mode=display">{HFE} = \sum w_f \cdot \frac{K_f}{G_f} = \sum \frac{G_f}{\sum G_f} \cdot \frac{K_f}{G_f}
 = \frac{\sum K_f}{\sum G_f} = \frac{K_f}{H_f} \cong \frac{\sum K_{fjp}}{\sum
 H_{fjp}}</script>
   <p>The contribution to the additional distance of each portion of the flight is
 proportional to the achieved distance of the same portion. The impact of
 short flights is therefore proportional to their lengths.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p><strong>What is the impact of unusual circumstances on the annual indicator?</strong></p>
   <p>When calculating the annual indicator the values for the ten best days and
the ten worst days are excluded from the computation.</p>
